| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm typecheck`                    | Type-check all three project references (app, node, worker)    |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix`       | ESLint over `**/*.{ts,tsx}`                                    |
| `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:check` | Prettier                                                       |
| `pnpm test:run`                     | Vitest single run across both projects (`frontend` + `worker`) |
| `pnpm test`                         | Vitest watch                                                   |

| `pnpm ci`                           | Full gate: format:check → lint → typecheck → test:run → build  |

**Do not run `pnpm dev`.** The user runs the dev server themselves; use `typecheck` / `lint` / `build` for verification.

### Running a single test

Vitest is configured as two projects, so target one with `--project`:

```bash
pnpm test:run --project frontend src/hooks/use-history.test.ts
pnpm test:run --project worker -t "cache hit"
```

The `worker` project runs in workerd via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` (real Cache API, real bindings); the `frontend` project runs in jsdom with **MSW** at the network boundary.

## Architecture

A single Cloudflare Worker ships both the SPA (static-asset binding) and three `/api/*` endpoints. One `wrangler deploy`, one origin, no CORS, and the WeatherAPI key never leaves the server.

The weather pipeline is split into two independently-cacheable tiers so the hero can paint without waiting for the full payload:

- `GET /api/weather` → current conditions, LCP-critical (10 min edge TTL)
- `GET /api/weather/forecast` → today + future days + astro + hourly (1 h edge TTL). Asks upstream for `days=3`, which is also the free-key cap, so `forecast` carries up to 3 days starting with today and `ForecastCard` renders whatever arrives — one column per day, each with its own precipitation line.
- `GET /api/search` → autocomplete (no edge cache; 60 s client-side staleTime in `useSuggestions`)

Key contracts that span multiple files:

- **`WeatherTier` is named once, in `src/lib/tiers.ts`.** The union `"current" | "forecast"` + `WEATHER_TIER_PATHS` is the only shared spine. Worker-side `SERVER_TIERS` (`src/worker/tiers.ts`) keys per-tier TTL / upstream fetch; frontend-side `CLIENT_TIERS` (`src/hooks/use-weather.ts`) keys per-tier stale/gc/refetch. Both are `Record<WeatherTier, …>`, so adding or renaming a tier is a one-row change on each side that TypeScript propagates. The per-tier Worker handler files were collapsed into `createTierHandler(tier)` in the same file. A third `yesterday` tier was removed once the forecast card stopped showing history; RFC 001 describes it as originally built.
- **DTO shapes defined once, in zod.** `src/lib/schemas.ts` is the single source of truth. Worker value-imports the schemas to validate upstream responses; frontend type-imports only, so zod is tree-shaken out of the client bundle. The frontend never sees the vendor's schema — swapping providers is one file in the Worker.
- **Display strings are formatted on the Worker, in both unit systems.** Every display quantity is a `MeasurePair` — `{ metric, imperial }`, each a `{ text, value, suffix, spoken }`. The client picks one with `read(pair, system)` from `src/lib/units.ts`; it does no conversion and no arithmetic. `airComfort` and `beaufort` run Worker-side too (`src/worker/air-comfort.ts`), because a classification must read one canonical field — the published Beaufort tables are independently rounded per unit, so classifying per display system would change the word when a viewer flips the toggle. What stays client-side is what feeds a colour, a bar width or an SVG angle: `pressureMb`, `uv`, `airQualityIndex`, `windDegree`, `humidity`, `cloud`.
- **`UnitSystem` is named once, in `src/lib/units.ts`.** The union `"metric" | "imperial"` keys `MeasurePair` in `schemas.ts` and the store in `src/hooks/use-unit-system.ts` (a persistent store over localStorage, defaulting from `navigator.language`'s region). Not the URL — a shared `?city=` link should read in the recipient's units.
- **The Worker formats what comes from the payload; the client formats what comes from the clock.** Every time and date in `src/components` goes through `src/lib/clock.ts`. Its only input is the viewer's locale — `navigator.language`, defaulted per function so call sites pass nothing; the unit system is not an input. `Intl` decides the hour cycle (`h11`/`h12` → `3:45 PM`, otherwise `15:45`), the day/month order and the weekday names. Tests pass an explicit locale as the last argument.
- **Closed error union end-to-end.** `src/lib/errors.ts` is a single table deriving the `kind ↔ status ↔ default-message` mappings. Adding a new kind is a one-row change that TypeScript propagates. The renderer in `WeatherResult` only special-cases `quota_exceeded` (full takeover) and `network`/`upstream`-without-data (retry CTA); other kinds fall through to previous-or-empty.
- **Retry policy is encoded in `src/lib/query-client.ts`.** User-meaningful kinds (`not_found`, `invalid_query`, `quota_exceeded`) never retry — they reach the UI instantly. `network` / `upstream` retry up to 2 times with exponential backoff capped at 5 s. `CLIENT_TIERS` carries no per-tier `retry` override, so this file is the whole policy.
- **Shared query normalization.** `normalizeQuery` in `src/lib/query.ts` is used by both the worker's edge-cache key and the frontend's TanStack Query key. Trimmed, lowercased, internal whitespace collapsed — so `London` / `london` / `LONDON ` share one cache entry per endpoint, and the two sides can't drift.
- **URL is the source of truth for the active city.** `?city=…` drives every weather fetch via `useSearchParam` (a `useSyncExternalStore` over the URL). `main.tsx` seeds the URL from history with `replaceState` on cold load. Autocomplete is the only debounced surface (300 ms, in `useSuggestions`); weather fetches fire only on URL change.
- **`keepPreviousData` keeps the previous card visible** during a new fetch — see the gotcha section below.
- **History via `useSyncExternalStore`** over localStorage. Every `useHistory()` consumer subscribes to the same in-module pub/sub; cross-tab updates ride the native `storage` event.
- **One persistent store, three adapters.** `createPersistentStore` in `src/lib/persistent-store.ts` owns the cached snapshot, the `storage` listener filtered on the key, the `typeof window` guards and the storage failure policy. History (`src/hooks/use-history/store.ts`), the unit system (`src/hooks/use-unit-system.ts`) and the first-run flag (`src/lib/first-run.ts`) each supply only a key, `decode` / `encode` and a `fallback`. `serverValue` is a separate option because units serve `metric` but default to the viewer's region.

Full design narrative lives in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md); RFCs in [`docs/rfcs/`](./docs/rfcs/).

## Conventions enforced by tooling

- **Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`** (both Vite and TS).
- **React Compiler is on** (`babel-plugin-react-compiler`). Avoid hand-rolled `useMemo`/`useCallback` unless there's a measured reason — the compiler handles memoization.
- **Strict TS** including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Array/record indexing yields `T | undefined`; optional props can't be set to `undefined` explicitly.
- **Zod is banned from the frontend bundle.** ESLint blocks `import "zod"` in `src/api`, `src/hooks`, `src/components`. Shared DTO types come from `@/lib/schemas` via **type-only** imports; the runtime schemas + zod itself live on the Worker side. See `docs/rfcs/008-zod-wire-boundaries.md`.
- **`src/components/ui/`** is vendored shadcn primitives — ESLint ignores it; don't reformat or refactor wholesale.

## Gotcha: bump `CACHE_VERSION` when changing DTO shapes

`src/worker/cache.ts` includes `CACHE_VERSION` (currently `"10"`) in every edge cache key. If you change a shape in `src/lib/schemas.ts` without bumping it, the previously-cached entries — still valid against the _old_ upstream schema — will continue to serve from `caches.default` and render against new client expectations as `undefined` fields. There's no automated guard; bumping is a discipline thing whenever the DTO surface changes.

## Gotcha: `keepPreviousData` + commit-on-success effects

Both weather hooks (`useWeather`, `useWeatherForecast`) use `placeholderData: keepPreviousData`. After a query-key change there's a window where `query.isSuccess === true` but `query.data` still points at the **previous** city's payload (`query.isPlaceholderData === true`). Any `useEffect` that correlates `query.data` with the current query key during that window will write stale data under a fresh key.

**Rule:** when gating on `query.isSuccess`, also gate on `!query.isPlaceholderData` (or wait for `isFetching === false`). The history-commit effect in `App.tsx` is the canonical example. `docs/architecture.md` has the full incident write-up.
