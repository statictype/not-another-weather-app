# Procedural Starfield & Celestial Phenomena - Three.js Skill

A Claude Code skill for generating stunning procedural night skies in Three.js — from scientifically-grounded starfields to dreamy nebulae to dramatic celestial events. **WebGPU compute with WebGL2 fallback**.

Part of the **Teaching Three.js** skill series.

## What This Skill Does

When installed, this skill teaches Claude Code how to generate complete night skies including:

- **Starfield** with blackbody spectral colors (O through M class), magnitude-based brightness/sizing, multi-frequency twinkle, and diffraction spikes on bright stars
- **Sky dome** with multi-stop gradient, horizon glow, light pollution, zodiacal light, and moon halo
- **Milky Way** band with FBM structure, dust lane subtraction, Sagittarius core brightening, and warm/cool tinting
- **Nebulae** — 5 types: emission (H-alpha/OIII/SII), reflection (blue scattering), dark (absorption silhouettes), planetary (shell structures), supernova remnants (filamentary). Volumetric raymarching on WebGPU, billboard sprites on WebGL
- **Moon** with procedural Voronoi craters, phase-accurate lighting, earthshine on dark side, and atmospheric glow sprite
- **Shooting stars / meteors** with flare-and-fade lifecycle and configurable shower rates
- **Comets** with dual-tail rendering (straight ion tail + curved dust tail)
- **Eclipses** — solar (corona, diamond ring) and lunar (blood red)
- **Constellations** with RA/Dec star positioning and line overlays
- **Deep-sky presets** — Orion, Pillars of Creation, Horsehead, Ring, Crab, Pleiades
- **Sky controller** orchestrating all layers with time-of-night progression
- **WGSL compute** for GPU star catalog generation with spectral distribution

## Installation

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude install-skill path/to/procedural-starfield
```

Or copy the `procedural-starfield/` folder into your Claude Code skills directory.

### Manual Usage

| File                              | Purpose                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SKILL.md`                        | Main skill — all 7 layers, celestial bodies, controller, presets          |
| `references/celestial-shaders.md` | Complete GLSL/WGSL for stars, sky dome, Milky Way, nebula, moon           |
| `references/celestial-catalog.md` | 5 nebula types, deep-sky presets, constellations, eclipses, mood profiles |

## Quick Start Prompts

> "Create a pristine mountain night sky with vivid Milky Way and shooting stars"

> "Build a deep space scene with emission nebulae and dense starfield"

> "Generate a full moon night with soft horizon glow and twinkling stars"

> "Create an alien sky with three moons and colorful nebulae"

> "Build a night sky with Orion constellation highlighted and proper star colors"

> "Create a meteor shower scene with 15,000 stars on a new moon night"

> "Generate a fantasy starfield with oversized moon and vivid purple-pink nebulae"

## Requirements

- **Three.js r170+** for WebGPU support and TSL node materials
- WebGPU browser (Chrome 121+, Edge 121+) for volumetric nebula raymarching and compute
- WebGL2 fallback (billboard nebulae, vertex-shader stars) works everywhere

## Key Concepts

### Layered Rendering

The night sky is composed of 7 additive layers, all using `THREE.AdditiveBlending` — no transparency sorting needed:

| Layer               | Content                    | Draw Calls |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1. Sky Dome         | Gradient + horizon glow    | 1          |
| 2. Stars            | Points with spectral color | 1          |
| 3. Milky Way        | FBM band on sphere         | 1          |
| 4. Nebulae          | Raymarched or billboard    | 1–3        |
| 5. Celestial Bodies | Moon + glow                | 2          |
| 6. Transients       | Meteors, comets            | 0–3        |
| 7. Deep Space       | Galaxies, clusters         | 0–2        |

**Total: 5–8 draw calls** for a complete night sky.

### Scientifically-Grounded Star Colors

Stars aren't white. Each star gets a temperature from the real spectral class distribution (76% red M-class, 12% orange K, 8% yellow G, etc.) converted to RGB via blackbody radiation. The result: a naturally warm-toned starfield with rare blue-white jewels.

### Five Nebula Types

Each type has distinct physics, appearance, and artistic character — from the vivid tendrils of emission nebulae to the ghostly absorption of dark nebulae to the jewel-like shells of planetary nebulae.

## Sky Mood Presets

| Preset            | Feel     | Stars | Milky Way   | Moon      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----- | ----------- | --------- |
| Pristine Mountain | Awe      | 12K   | Vivid       | New       |
| Full Moon Night   | Romantic | 4K    | Faint       | Full      |
| Suburban          | Familiar | 2K    | Hidden      | Quarter   |
| Meteor Shower     | Exciting | 10K   | Rich        | New       |
| Deep Space        | Cosmic   | 20K   | Maximum     | None      |
| Fantasy           | Dreamy   | 20K   | Exaggerated | Oversized |
